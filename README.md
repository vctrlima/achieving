## How to start the application
First, it is necessary to install the project's dependencies by running the `yarn` command inside the `app` and `api` folders located in the root.

To run the [Angular](https://angular.io/) development environment on your local machine, just access the `app` folder and type `yarn start` in your terminal.

Similarly, you will also have to run the backend application by typing `yarn start` in the `api` folder.

If you are using Visual Studio Code, the front-end application already has a script for you to run debugging directly in the IDE, eliminating the need to upload the application by typing the yarn start command in the Angular directory.
